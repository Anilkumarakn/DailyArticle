Daily Article Application
The Daily Article Application is an Android application built using Android Studio and Kotlin. It is designed to provide users with a daily dose of interesting articles on various topics. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern and utilizes the WordPress API for making API calls. The user interface is created using RelativeLayout.
Features
•	Display daily articles: The application fetches articles from the WordPress API and displays them to the user.
•	Categorized articles: The articles are organized into categories such as Technology, Science, Entertainment, etc., making it easy for users to browse through their preferred topics.
•	Article details: Users can view the full details of an article, including the title, author, date, and content.
•	Share articles: Users can share articles with others through various sharing options available on their device.
Architecture
The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. This pattern separates the user interface (View) from the underlying data (Model) and introduces a ViewModel that acts as a mediator between the View and the Model. The key components of the MVVM architecture in this application are:
•	Model: The Model layer represents the data and business logic. It includes classes responsible for fetching data from the WordPress API, parsing the response, and providing the necessary data to the ViewModel.
•	View: The View layer consists of activities, fragments, and layout files responsible for displaying the user interface. In this application, RelativeLayout is used as the primary layout for arranging UI components.
•	ViewModel: The ViewModel layer acts as a bridge between the View and the Model. It retrieves data from the Model and exposes it to the View for display. It also handles user interactions from the View and communicates with the Model to update the data.
Dependencies
The Daily Article Application relies on the following dependencies:
•	AndroidX: Android Jetpack libraries for modern Android development.
•	Kotlin Coroutines: For handling asynchronous operations in a simplified and scalable manner.
•	Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for making API calls and interacting with the WordPress API.
•	Gson: A library for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
•	Glide: For efficient image loading and caching.
•	ViewModel: Part of the Android Jetpack, used for managing and preserving UI-related data during configuration changes.
Installation
To run the Daily Article Application on your local machine, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2.	Open the project in Android Studio.
3.	Build the project to download the required dependencies.
4.	Connect an Android device or emulator to your machine.
5.	Run the application on the connected device or emulator.
Configuration
Before running the application, ensure that you have configured the following:
1.	Obtain an API key from the WordPress API.
2.	Update the API key in the application's configuration file (e.g., Constants.kt or Config.kt).
3.	Configure the necessary permissions and dependencies in the build.gradle file.
Conclusion
The Daily Article Application provides a convenient way for users to discover and read interesting articles on a daily basis. By leveraging the MVVM architecture, it separates concerns and provides a modular and maintainable codebase. The usage of the WordPress API enables seamless integration with a vast repository of articles, while RelativeLayout allows for flexible UI design. Feel free to explore and enhance the application to suit your specific requirements.
